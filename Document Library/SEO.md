SEO

In the brick and mortar world, it has been said that success is about location, location, location.  In the digital world, this saying still rings true, with the location being the top of the search engine results. The key then is how to get to the top with ever changing search algorithms, used by different search engines.  Then there is another aspect of knowing your customers or at least those looking to be your customers.  In that what words are they using or how are they combining those words when conducting a search?  Those are all factors when using meta data, pages titles and using classes within a semantic web design.

In reading the Moz SEO introduction guide (https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo), I have learned what SEO is and isnâ€™t, that there are good techniques to get a good SEO rating and those techniques are fairly common sense such as having clear content, good links, original content, and few or no advertisement links.  And that there are bad techniques that will negatively impact SEO ratings, and could even get a site de-indexed from search results.  These techniques would be having a page represent one thing to a crawler, but have other content for the visitor, having bad links, or to falsely inflated links.

A final thought on SEO and getting the best results is to know your clients, know your business goals, and where your website fits in.  While most of the talk is getting a high SEO, the key is that you want; visitors to stay on your site, purchase your products or what ever your goal is, the SEO is a means to get them there, but your site is what keeps them there.

Plan for site SEO implementation
1.  Nuxt allows for editing at the site level, edits should be done first at this level with the various meta tags to  
2.  Nuxt allows for editing header data at the page level, both the title can be added and additional meta data can be added to make the page relevant to crawlers
3. Nuxt allows for editing meta data and headers for dynamically created pages that should be added
4.  If redirects are required, set up server middleware to do 301 directs.  According to Moz, 301 redirects do not take hits from web crawlers, to the same degree as 302 and 307 redirects
5. Install Google Analytics to monitor pages
6.  Create a dynamic site map 
7.  Keep track of Meta tags added to avoid duplicate tags,  duplicate tags are thought to lower search ratings.
